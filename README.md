# Styling Scrollbars with CSS: The Modern Way to Style Scrollbars

[William Le](https://alligator.io/author/william-le)

Since the early days of the web, customizing the browser‚Äôs scrollbar has proven to be very difficult to standardize across major browsers. Fortunately, on September 2018 a W3C Working Draft called  [CSS Scrollbars](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-css-scrollbars-1-20180925)  was released that looks like a viable way to finally accomplish this!

Styling the scrollbar in the browser can be an valuable way to communicate a company‚Äôs brand. For example, styling the Alligator.io website‚Äôs scrollbars could look like this:

![Alligator.io custom scrollbar style screenshot](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/44bf8a85b93bcddc7bb8b503f4d0c4666334668e/1126e/images/css/css-scrollbars/scrollbar-styling-1.png)

Throughout the years, there emerged many ways to accomplish this. Microsoft Internet Explorer was one of the first vendors to provide a CSS API for this, but many indie developers were so frustrated to find a solution that they  [created](https://plugins.jquery.com/custom-scrollbar/)  [various](https://github.com/Grsmto/simplebar)  [solutions](https://github.com/buzinas/simple-scrollbar)  with JavaScript.

Fast-forward to today, now that Internet Explorer is slowly being replaced by Microsoft Edge, it just boils down to 2 approaches:

-   _Chrome/Edge/Safari_: using  `-webkit-scrollbar`
-   _Firefox_: uses the new CSS Scrollbars API (eg.,  `scrollbar-color`  and  `scrollbar-width`) spec.

Let‚Äôs jump into some code samples!

The JavaScript solutions fall short since they have difficulty emulating high-end behaviors like inertia scrolling (eg., decaying motion when scrolling via trackpads). üò≠

Styling scrollbars for Chrome/Edge/Safari is available behind the vendor prefix  [_-webkit-scrollbar_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::-webkit-scrollbar)

```
body::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 12px;               /* width of the entire scrollbar */
}
body::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
  background: orange;        /* color of the tracking area */
}
body::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background-color: blue;    /* color of the scroll thumb */
  border-radius: 20px;       /* roundness of the scroll thumb */
  border: 3px solid orange;  /* creates padding around scroll thumb */
}

```

But there‚Äôs good news‚Ä¶ And bad news:

**Good news!**  This code works üëå perfectly fine in the latest releases of Chrome/Edge/Safari!

**Bad news?**  Unfortunately, this spec has been formally  [abandoned by W3C](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::-webkit-scrollbar)  so we can expect it to be slowly deprecated in the coming years.

Microsoft Edge officially  [switched](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4501095/download-the-new-microsoft-edge-based-on-chromium "link to news release")  to the Chromium V8 engine on January 2020!

Firefox is a champion of new W3C standards, and they‚Äôre always willing to try out emerging APIs. As such, the new  [CSS Scrollbars](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scrollbars)  features are already available in normal releases of Firefox:

```
body {
  scrollbar-width: thin;          /* "auto" or "thin"  */
  scrollbar-color: blue orange;   /* scroll thumb & track */ 
}

```

![scrollbars on firefox](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7ac585bfb02e1c95a8b0d33b8eb28fbcc14284ee/4b3fc/images/css/css-scrollbars/scrollbar-styling-3.png)

Sweet! You might have noticed a few differences compared to the deprecated  `-webkit-scrollbar`  spec.

Firstly, it‚Äôs way more concise! And secondly, it lacks features like creating a padding and roundness for the ‚Äútrack thumb‚Äù. Since the spec is still changing, these missing features could likely get included.

## [](https://alligator.io/css/css-scrollbars/#the-way-forward)The Way Forward

How do we style scrollbars considering there isn‚Äôt a single, authoritative API? Just combine both approaches!

```
/* The emerging W3C standard
   that is currently Firefox-only */
* {
  scrollbar-width: thin;
  scrollbar-color: blue orange;
}

/* Works on Chrome/Edge/Safari */
*::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 12px;
}
*::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
  background: orange;
}
*::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background-color: blue;
  border-radius: 20px;
  border: 3px solid orange;
}

```

Once  _-webkit-scrollbar_  is deprecated, you can fallback on the new  _CSS Scrollbars_  standard without missing a beat.
